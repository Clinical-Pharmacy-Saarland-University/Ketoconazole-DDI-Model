# Ketoconazole-DDI-Model
Modeling of published clinical ketoconazole studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body parent-metabolite PBPK model for ketoconazole (and its metabolites N-deacetylketoconazole and N-hydroxy-N-deacetylketoconazole). The model was developed using published clinical studies and its predicted performance was evaluated within our DDI network. The file "Ketoconazole-Model" contains simulations of the published clinical studies used during model establishment, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation, please refer to [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/15/2/679)]. Furthermore, the DDI files conatin simulations of published clinical DDI studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the ketoconazole model regarding the DDIs with the CYP3A4 victim drugs alfentanil, alprazolam, midazolam and triazolam, as well as the P-gp victim drug digoxin, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied alfentanil, alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam and digoxin models have been published previously [[2](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/psp4.12343)-[4](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSP-PBPK-Model-Library/blob/v9.1/Alprazolam/Alprazolam_evaluation_report.pdf)].
